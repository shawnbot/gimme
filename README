Gimme is a JavaScript library for creating HTML image maps from geographic
feature data in GeoJSON format. It uses other, tried-and-true libraries (such
as ModestMaps and Polymaps) to project geographic coordinates into screen
coordinates, and can easily be backed onto other libraries that provide similar
functionality.

The goal of gimme is to make geographic image maps a reality in both ancient
and modern web browsers.
